        <title>Ways of Seeing</title>
        <link>/ways-of-seeing/</link>
        <description><p><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/29/ways-of-seeing/">Tom Critchlow argues that art is the best place to learn sensemaking and observation skills</a>. He applies it to understanding the culture of an organization you’re consulting for, but it perfectly applies to note-making as well.</p>
<p>Critically examine what’s in front of you by keeping the context in frame.</p>
<p>Who is presenting the information? What is their motivation in presenting the information? Do you trust them? Is there anything that would cause them to be biased in some way?</p>
<p>What format is it presented in? How does the format affect the message? If it’s a Tweet, you can probably assume it’s surface-level and incomplete.</p>
<p>Do you notice any patterns? Are there any gaps in the provided information?</p>
<p>All of these things require moving past passive consumption and really paying attention to what you’re reading, giving it your full attention, and actively engaging in a dialogue with it.</p>

        <title>Embracing Uncertainty</title>
        <link>/uncertainty/</link>
        <description><p>Our brains want to move away from uncertainty, however uncertainty can be a vital ingredient for creativity. So the question becomes, how do we determine if the uncertainty we're feeling is the productive kind we should lean into or the kind that's actually signaling the need for more information.</p>
<p>Perfectionism will always tell us that we need more information before we can begin or before we can publish. This is often a convenient subconscious lie to help us avoid the discomfort of vulnerability.</p>
<p>I don't have an answer to this one. It's going on my list of important questions so I can keep it at the forefront of my mind as I build my course.</p>

        <title>A Mental Model for AI Use</title>
        <link>/reverse-centaur/</link>
        <description><p>I recently spoke with my potential advisor, who said she would like to hear my views on AI in the classroom when we meet next semester.</p>
<p>The next day, in a moment of serendipity, <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/commentary-cory-doctorow-reverse-centaurs/">Cory Doctorow wrote about reverse-centaurs in his newsletter.</a></p>
<p>My first thought was, &quot;This is a fantastic mental model for AI.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't become the assistant in your own thinking.</p>
<p>According to the essay, a centaur is a person who uses AI to assist them with mundane tasks. Doctorow's example involves using Whisper to scan 40 hours of audio files to find a specific claim from a podcast. Something he never would have had time to do himself.</p>
<p>A reverse-centaur is a person who becomes an assistant to the AI. The example given is a freelancer who is hired for a job, but not given enough time to complete it correctly. This individual freelancer has no choice but to delegate all of the work to AI, because they're doing a job that used to be done by dozens of journalists and interns.</p>
<p>These are obviously extreme ends of a full spectrum of AI use, and most users are likely to fall somewhere in the middle. But even if you aren't a full reverse-centaur, it's important to remain mindful of how you're using AI in the moment.</p>
<h2>My views on AI in the classroom</h2>
<p>Students are going to use AI whether it’s against the rules or not. They need to be taught how to use it in a way that doesn’t disrupt their own thinking.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect of note-making is learning and/or clarifying your thoughts through personal connections and analogies. Because personal thought is so foundational to a course on generative note-making, I think it's perfect for introducing these ideas.</p>
<p>One of the biggest hurdles currently is school administrations that are focused on preventing the most obvious reverse-centaur behavior, cheating. But this is one of those areas where we have a choice. We can bury our heads in the sand and hope impulsive teenagers will follow the rules and avoid AI altogether, or we can face the reality that there will always be students who figure out new ways to cheat. These aren't the students they should be worried about.</p>
<p>The students who would benefit most from education have good intentions. They're not the type who would normally cheat on an exam or plagiarize a paper, but they don't see using AI against the rules as cheating. They may genuinely believe they're learning while unintentionally outsourcing the most important cognitive work to AI.</p>
<p>This is because AI makes it easy to fall into a version of <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/">the collector's fallacy</a>. The collector's fallacy warns us that we often believe we know something when we actually just know about something. This connection just occurred to me while writing this newsletter. It's a brand new seed that I need to grow a bit before writing about it further.</p>
<p>Education can help these students understand the difference between AI use that tricks you into thinking you're learning the knowledge and AI use that actually aids in learning.</p>
<h2>Centaurs in the classroom</h2>
<p>Centaur mode for the classroom could look like AI scanning your notes to consolidate all your thoughts on a specific topic. It could be summarizing a freewriting session to eliminate all of the noise. It could be uploading an academic paper you just read, along with your analysis, to make sure you understood it correctly.</p>
<p>The common factor here is that you've done your own work first. You've synthesized the reading and written on the topic to clarify your own thoughts before you even touch AI.</p>
<p>The only thing I would use AI for before this point is having it search for relevant papers and sources on the topic for you to read.</p>
<p>Using AI to produce a first draft for you is a good example of the spectrum I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Centaur:</strong> You've done all of the research and have written quite a bit yourself. You feed all of this information into the model and have it provide a first draft using your words. Now all of that previously chaotic information is organized and ready for your informed rewrites.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse-Centaur:</strong> You've done little to no research or writing yourself. You feed the model your topic and ask for a first draft essay. AI has now done the bulk of the work, all of the &quot;thinking,&quot; and you're just its assistant, doing small edits.</p>
<p>Anyone who uses AI regularly probably shifts between centaur and reverse-centaur modes without realizing it. Using this mental model to be aware of which mode we're in can help us make more deliberate choices about when and how we use AI.</p>

        <title>Experiment 01 - Consume Higher Quality Content</title>
        <link>/experiment-01/</link>
        <description><p>Start Date: Aug 18, 2025 | End Date: Sept 13, 2025</p>
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>What happens when I replace unstructured, low-quality input (mostly social media) with a structured, high-quality information diet (newsletters, academic papers, articles, books)?</p>
<h2>Baseline</h2>
<p>I scroll social media and read any interesting articles I come across, which lately is happening less and less. I read books, but not regularly. I seek out information when I need it and immediately use it. Rather than being an information hoarder, I get caught in cognitive loops. I practically ruminate on knowledge.</p>
<h2>Intervention</h2>
<ul>
<li>Limit social media to 20 minutes/day</li>
<li>Shift reading to:
<ul>
<li>Peer-reviewed articles</li>
<li>Curated newsletters &amp; websites</li>
<li>Books of all types and genres</li>
<li>Thinking/learning communities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Operational Definitions</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seed saved</strong>: Captured something, added the source, added why I saved it</li>
<li><strong>Seed planted</strong>: Began transformation by turning the seed into a new note with a link, or working the seed into an existing note</li>
<li><strong>Seed pruned</strong>: Information deleted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm officially ending the experiment at week 4. Tracking has become more burdensome than useful. I'm not sure if it's because I have so much reading for school right now, or because I've learned all I needed to learn from the experiment, but I had no meaningful data, nor any new insights in week 4. I learned a lot from this experiment, and changed my reading habits for the better in the process. I'm working on an official wrap-up that I should have finished in a week or two. Until then, you can see the raw data and field notes below.</p>

<h4>Field Notes</h4>
<p><strong>2025-08-18:</strong>
I had an idea for a tool containing all my favorite thinking sites, with a button to get a random article. It seemed perfect for this experiment. I totally vibe-coded it in PHP. And since I don't know PHP, it ate up my time for the day. It was my first time vibe-coding, and it was pretty fun. It was probably a form of procrastination, but I think it'll be a useful tool for the coming weeks. Either way, I love my Random Knowledge Generator!</p>
<p><strong>2025-08-19:</strong>
Social media was more productive. With only 20 minutes allowed, I had to focus on actual engagement rather than mindless scrolling.
Unscheduled reading becomes invisible. When I read outside my designated blocked times, I didn't take notes, didn't log it, and didn't even track it as reading time. This surprised me. When reading isn't scheduled, it becomes completely automatic and passive.
I signed up for Readwise to sync highlights to my mind garden automatically. Maybe it'll help some with the unscheduled reading. You can even include notes with your highlights so I can reflect when I save.
Though I didn't plant any seeds while reading one of the blog posts, it still contributed to an interesting connection I made between all three readings.</p>
<p><strong>2025-08-20:</strong>
The single academic reading produced more notes than the two blog posts combined, which only yielded one note between them.</p>
<p><strong>2025-08-22:</strong>
This is the second time this week that I've been able to connect multiple readings together, even though I chose them spontaneously. Today, I was able to connect the two blog posts I read to the textbook reading I had.</p>

<h4>Field Notes</h4>
<p><strong>2025-08-25:</strong>
I noticed a feeling of anxiety while reading Kevin Kelly's self-publishing article. Even though I wasn't expecting to save anything from it, I felt some stress halfway through when I had yet to save a seed. The experiment is creating subtle pressure that interferes with my natural reading patterns.
I finally remembered to use my random article generator and found the Maggie Appleton article. I have a feeling this is an amazing resource I've been neglecting. If I don't use it then it's creation was just procrastination after all.</p>
<p><strong>2025-08-26:</strong>
Sometimes I need to let myself fall down rabbit holes. Daily logging is revealing some extremely useful patterns but it's also killing some of my natural curiosity. When tracking everything, it becomes impossible to explore topics freely and get into a flow with the information. Today I chose to abandon logging temporarily and jumped into an epistemic disclosure statements rabbit hole.
Academic papers and textbooks for my coursework and capstone tend to bypass the seed phase. It's deep work where new information is immediately processed into new notes or existing evergreen notes.</p>
<p><strong>2025-08-28:</strong>
Autoimmune flare-up began, limiting my cognitive capacity for remainder of week.</p>

<p><strong>Experiment Evolution - New Reading Taxonomy</strong>
Discovered Reading Types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seed-Reading</strong>: Newsletters and blog posts where I may be quickly introduced to a new concept. I create a seed so I can come back to it and learn more about it</li>
<li><strong>Deep-Reading</strong>: Academic, informative non-fiction. Information is immediately processed into new notes or existing evergreen notes</li>
<li><strong>Serendipitous Reading</strong>: Falling down rabbit holes (I only track the source of the fall)</li>
<li><strong>Relaxing Reading</strong>: Fiction &amp; pulp. For me, horror, dystopia, fantasy, auto-bios of extreme and complex people</li>
<li><strong>Sunshine Reading</strong>: Art, poetry, writing from people I deeply resonate with. Very often unexpected surprises from any form.</li>

<h4>Field Notes</h4>
<p>It's 1am, Friday morning, and the last day of reading for week 3 of my planned 8 week experiment. Course reading and work took the entire week, and sitting here in the quiet of the witching hour, my favorite time for personal relaxation, is the first time I've had to read something just for myself all week.</p>
<p>I choose an essay from Emergence Magazine, Museum of Color. I'm a painter. I have a deep love of natural pigments. I devoured the article, taking in every word, and saving no seeds in the process. This wasn't a seed bearing article, it was a soul feeding article. I didn't need to save or capture anything (other than bookmarking it so I can read it again).</p>
<p>At first I thought this was a sign that it's time to wrap up experiment 01 early and declare it a rousing success. Changing my information diet did so much more than expected. I expected both a higher quantity and quality of seeds, notes, and insights, which my new diet did produce. However, it's also changing the way I take notes and seeds just aren't a great indicator of these changes.</p>
<p>Because I saved no new seeds this week. Instead I planted 11 new sprout notes, created a map of content, and grew one evergreen note. The entire first semester of my program is focused on theory. So this week was spent building the &quot;Communication Theory&quot; MOC with the first 12 theories, covering cognition and culture. I made a connection on how one of the theories could be used in an educational setting, which grew one of the sprout notes into an evergreen with my own added insights.</p>
<p>Bonus: I've also noticed an improvement in my attention span since moving away from the click-bait nature of social media.</p>
<p>However, after giving it some further thought, I think I would rather tweak the experiment some and see what else I might learn about this personal taxonomy that I'm excitedly watching emerge.</p>
