## Capstone Project

I started my master's program in August (2025). The first semester foundational, focused on problem solving through theory & research. We're meant to take this time to choose the direction we want to go in, and reach out to potential advisors to find a good match. I'll be able to share more specifics about my project once I've officially met with my advisor.
