[Tom Critchlow argues that art is the best place to learn sensemaking and observation skills](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/29/ways-of-seeing/). He applies it to understanding the culture of an organization you’re consulting for, but it perfectly applies to note-making as well.

Critically examine what’s in front of you by keeping the context in frame.

Who is presenting the information? What is their motivation in presenting the information? Do you trust them? Is there anything that would cause them to be biased in some way?

What format is it presented in? How does the format affect the message? If it’s a Tweet, you can probably assume it’s surface-level and incomplete.

Do you notice any patterns? Are there any gaps in the provided information?

All of these things require moving past passive consumption and really paying attention to what you’re reading, giving it your full attention, and actively engaging in a dialogue with it.
