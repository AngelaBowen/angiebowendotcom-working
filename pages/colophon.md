## Site Purpose:
I started this site to build my master's capstone in public. Then <a href="/experiment-01">my first personal experiment</a> sent me down a rabbit hole of digital gardens, the indieweb, the handmade web, and any other cozy corner of the internet that felt like the 90s web I so loved.

Now it's my digital garden, where I learn and create in public.
