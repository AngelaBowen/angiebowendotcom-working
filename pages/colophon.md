## Site Purpose:
I started this site to build my master's capstone in public. Then <a href="/experiment-01">my first personal experiment</a> sent me down a rabbit hole of digital gardens, the indieweb, the handmade web, and any other corner of the cozy internet I could find that felt like the 90s web I so loved.

Now it's my digital garden, where I learn and create in public.

## Tech Stack:
- Written in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (where the majority of my work happens) using markdown
- Theme hand-coded HTML and CSS in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>
- Static site generated with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>
- Minimal JS (mostly pulled from Stack Overflow as I have yet to learn JavaScript)
- Site hosted on Dreamhost

## Design Principles:
- No tracking (no Google Analytics, no cookies, no scripts)
- No ads, sponsored posts, or affiliate links
- Keep it fast-loading and lightweight
- My site is represented by an ampersand (&), a symbol of connections, which gets to the heart of my work.

## Accessibility:
- My goal is to use only text and Unicode for site theming, avoiding images for pure aesthetics. 
- JavaScript will never be required to read or use the site.
- Readability and accessibility are always my top priorities.

## Fonts:
- All fonts are self-hosted on this domain for privacy and performance. No external font services are used.
