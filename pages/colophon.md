## Site Purpose:
I started this site to build my master's capstone in public. Then <a href="/experiment-01">my first personal experiment</a> sent me down a rabbit hole of digital gardens, the indieweb, the handmade web, and any other cozy corner of the internet I could find that felt like the 90s web I so loved.

Now it's my digital garden, where I learn and create in public.

## Tech Stack:
- Written in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>
- Coded in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>
- Built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>
- Hand-coded HTML and CSS with minimal JS

## Design Principles:
- No tracking (no Google Analytics, no cookies, no scripts)
- No ads, sponsored posts, or affiliate links
- Prioritize readability and accessibility
- Fast-loading and lightweight
- My logo is an ampersand (&) because it's a symbol of connections, which gets to the heart of my work.

## Fonts:
- [Playfair Display](https://beautifulwebtype.com/playfair-display/)
- [Be Vietnam Pro](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/beVietnam-pro)
