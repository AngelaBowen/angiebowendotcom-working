The year is 1999, and I'm happily clicking away on a behemoth of a beige box desktop computer. I'm carefully linking HTML pages together, forming a complex and intricate choose-your-own-adventure story. Click here to go deeper into the woods. Click here to rest in the abandoned cabin. Each choice leads to another branching path through my hypertext narrative labyrinth.

I didn't know it then, but I was creating the first vestiges of what would become my life's work more than two decades later (more on that in a minute).

Back then, the web was an experimental wild west. Website aesthetics were limited only to their creator's imagination. We had dancing gifs and psychedelic light shows. We had hot pink text on a yellow background that burned your eyes out of your head. And we had iframes, nested in tables meant for text, that we slotted sliced up images around to create a dollhouse for our pixel art. Yes, that last one was also me.

But then everything changed. It started with the homogenized aesthetic of chronological blogs. Then social media stole any originality that remained and bound our attention to the mighty algorithm.

Many of us would love to get back to our hypertext roots. And that's exactly what digital gardens allow us to do.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas organized by organic connections between concepts. Rather than explore ideas chronologically, digital gardens let us navigate them much like our actual brains would, associatively.

When I stumbled across the concept of digital gardens in 2020, I began creating one as a pandemic project, something to tinker with to pass the time.

## 40+ years of writing and nothing to show for it

The first story I remember writing was about how turkeys don't like Thanksgiving. I was 5 years old and not clever enough say they have nothing to be thankful for, but still pretty forward thinking for a 5 year old. A bit of important context; I was raised on a farm, so I was just writing about what I saw. I wasn't a 5 year old reading The Sexual Politics of Meat or anything.

I wrote in notebooks my whole life, and never kept a single one. I created my first website in the late 90s and have been writing and creating online ever since. I lost those backups a few years ago when my laptop and external hard drive died at around the same time. The point is, I've never been careful about saving my work.

I see people like <a href="https://gwern.net/">Gwern</a> and <a href="https://pluralistic.net/">Cory Doctorow</a> who have been documenting their knowledge online for 30 years and I kick myself for saving nothing over the decades. PKM changed that for me, but I've only known about PKM for 2 years and I'm 49 years old. That's a lot of years of writing and personal knowledge lost. 

I would give anything to have it all back but all I can do is move forward and begin documenting at the ripe age of 50. 

To that end, my target audience is now me. I wrote for others for so many years, I'm still trying to get rid of the last vestiges of marketing that creeps into my voice. Now I want to write for myself, for my own curiosity and understanding.

I've been cultivating a private mind garden since I came across <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">Maggie Appleton's article on digital gardens</a>. When I discovered PKM and Obsidian, linked notes obviously resonated with me. I figured it was time I created my own public garden.
