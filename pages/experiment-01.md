excerpt: My first n=1 experiment on improving my information diet by replacing low-quality, unstructured input with high-quality, curated content.
author: Angie Bowen
keywords: [Experiment, Note-Making]

Start Date: Aug 18, 2025 | End Date: Sept 13, 2025

## Hypothesis
What happens when I replace unstructured, low-quality input (mostly social media) with a structured, high-quality information diet (newsletters, academic papers, articles, books)?

## Baseline
I scroll social media and read any interesting articles I come across, which lately is happening less and less. I read books, but not regularly. I seek out information when I need it and immediately use it. Rather than being an information hoarder, I get caught in cognitive loops. I practically ruminate on knowledge.

## Intervention
Limit social media to 20 minutes/day.
Shift reading to:
- Peer-reviewed articles
- Curated newsletters & websites
- Books of all types and genres
- Thinking/learning communities (Ness Labs and Linking Your Thinking)

### Operational Definitions
- Seed saved: Captured something, added the source, added why I saved it.
- Seed planted: Began transformation by turning the seed into a new note with a link, or working the seed into an existing note.
- Seed pruned: Information deleted.

## Conclusion
I'm officially ending the experiment at week 4. Tracking has become more burdensome than useful. I'm not sure if it's because I have so much reading for school right now, or because I've learned all I needed to learn from the experiment, but I had no meaningful data, nor any new insights in week 4. I learned a lot from this experiment, and changed my reading habits for the better in the process. I'm working on an official wrap-up that I should have finished in a week or two. Until then, you can see the raw data and field notes below.

#### Field Notes
**2025-08-18:**
I had an idea for a tool containing all my favorite thinking sites, with a button to get a random article. It seemed perfect for this experiment. I totally vibe-coded it in PHP. And since I don't know PHP, it ate up my time for the day. It was my first time vibe-coding, and it was pretty fun. It was probably a form of procrastination, but I think it'll be a useful tool for the coming weeks. Either way, I love my Random Knowledge Generator!

**2025-08-19:**
Social media was more productive. With only 20 minutes allowed, I had to focus on actual engagement rather than mindless scrolling.
Unscheduled reading becomes invisible. When I read outside my designated blocked times, I didn't take notes, didn't log it, and didn't even track it as reading time. This surprised me. When reading isn't scheduled, it becomes completely automatic and passive.
I signed up for Readwise to sync highlights to my mind garden automatically. Maybe it'll help some with the unscheduled reading. You can even include notes with your highlights so I can reflect when I save.
Though I didn't plant any seeds while reading one of the blog posts, it still contributed to an interesting connection I made between all three readings.

**2025-08-20:**
The single academic reading produced more notes than the two blog posts combined, which only yielded one note between them.

**2025-08-22:**
This is the second time this week that I've been able to connect multiple readings together, even though I chose them spontaneously. Today, I was able to connect the two blog posts I read to the textbook reading I had.

#### Weekly Review
- **10 Items Consumed**
- **12 Seeds Saved**
- **5 Seeds Planted**
- **2 Seeds Pruned**
- **120% Seed Generation Rate**
- **41% Plant Rate**
- **16% Prune Rate**

**This Week:**
- Some friction emerged this week from different modes of reading.
- Newsletters are still dominating my reading. They're producing seeds but I need more variety.
- An autoimmune flare up cut the week short.

**Next Week:**
- Balance measurement with organic discovery.
- Branch out from newsletters. Add some book chapters.
- Remain mindful of pressure to save seeds.

#### Field Notes
**2025-08-25:**
I noticed a feeling of anxiety while reading Kevin Kelly's self-publishing article. Even though I wasn't expecting to save anything from it, I felt some stress halfway through when I had yet to save a seed. The experiment is creating subtle pressure that interferes with my natural reading patterns.
I finally remembered to use my random article generator and found the Maggie Appleton article. I have a feeling this is an amazing resource I've been neglecting. If I don't use it then it's creation was just procrastination after all.

**2025-08-26:**
Sometimes I need to let myself fall down rabbit holes. Daily logging is revealing some extremely useful patterns but it's also killing some of my natural curiosity. When tracking everything, it becomes impossible to explore topics freely and get into a flow with the information. Today I chose to abandon logging temporarily and jumped into an epistemic disclosure statements rabbit hole.
Academic papers and textbooks for my coursework and capstone tend to bypass the seed phase. It's deep work where new information is immediately processed into new notes or existing evergreen notes.

**2025-08-28:**
Autoimmune flare-up began, limiting my cognitive capacity for remainder of week.

**Experiment Evolution - New Reading Taxonomy**
Discovered Reading Types:
- Seed-Reading: Newsletters and blog posts where I may be quickly introduced to a new concept. I create a seed so I can come back to it and learn more about it.
- Deep-Reading: Academic, informative non-fiction. Information is immediately processed into new notes or existing evergreen notes.
- Serendipitous Reading: Falling down rabbit holes (I only track the source of the fall).
- Relaxing Reading: Fiction & pulp. For me, horror, dystopia, fantasy, auto-bios of extreme and complex people.
- Soul Reading: Art, poetry, writing from people I deeply resonate with. Very often unexpected surprises from any form.

**Updated Tracking (Starting Week 4):**
- Total seeds saved weekly with source type
- Total sprouts planted weekly with source type
- Total evergreens grown weekly with source type
- Connections made this week
- Relaxing Reading: What and duration
- Soul Reading: What it was and how it fed me
- Rabbit Hole: What caused the fall & topic

#### Field Notes
It's 1am, Friday morning, and the last day of reading for week 3 of my planned 8 week experiment. Course reading and work took the entire week, and sitting here in the quiet of the witching hour, my favorite time for personal relaxation, is the first time I've had to read something just for myself all week.

I choose an essay from Emergence Magazine, Museum of Color. I'm a painter. I have a deep love of natural pigments. I devoured the article, taking in every word, and saving no seeds in the process. This wasn't a seed bearing article, it was a soul feeding article. I didn't need to save or capture anything (other than bookmarking it so I can read it again).

At first I thought this was a sign that it's time to wrap up experiment 01 early and declare it a rousing success. Changing my information diet did so much more than expected. I expected both a higher quantity and quality of seeds, notes, and insights, which my new diet did produce. However, it's also changing the way I take notes and seeds just aren't a great indicator of these changes.

Because I saved no new seeds this week. Instead I planted 11 new sprout notes, created a map of content, and grew one evergreen note. The entire first semester of my program is focused on theory. So this week was spent building the "Communication Theory" MOC with the first 12 theories, covering cognition and culture. I made a connection on how one of the theories could be used in an educational setting, which grew one of the sprout notes into an evergreen with my own added insights.

Bonus: I've also noticed an improvement in my attention span since moving away from the click-bait nature of social media.

However, after giving it some further thought, I think I would rather tweak the experiment some and see what else I might learn about this personal taxonomy that I'm excitedly watching emerge.
