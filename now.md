## Capstone Project

I'm developing a course for first-year undergraduates on generative note-making. The first semester is theory focused. While we're doing work choosing the theoretical foundations we want to work with, they're evaluating our choices and matching up students with advisors. So I'll be able to share more specifics about my project when I'm assigned an advisor.
