	I write about generative note-making, creativity, and digital literacy. I'm currently a grad student working on a practical applicaton capstone in communication. My academic work sits at the intersection of communication, education, and psychology (my undergraduate degree).
</h2>
<p>I'm a painter so visual art often makes its way into my work. I love designing websites and exploring the intersection of art and technology. That's what initially drew me to digital gardens. I'm a huge fan of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indieweb</a> and love to see individuals express themselves through personal sites.</p>
<p>I've been cultivating my personal mind garden in Obsidian for a couple of years and making some of these notes public is the next natural progression. It's easy to let individual notes sit in disarray when they're completely private. Sharing them with others, helps me to organize and express them in a way that makes sense to someone else.</p>

<div class="quote-container"><blockquote>“Imagination is the Combining Faculty. It brings together things, facts, ideas, conceptions, in new, original, endless, ever varying, Combinations. It seizes points in common, between subjects having no very apparent connexion, & hence seldom or never brought into juxtaposition.”</blockquote><p class="quote-author">~ Ada Lovelace</p></div>
